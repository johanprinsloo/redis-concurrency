Whilst we studie to be thankful in our particular, for  the many
favors we have received from your L.L. we are falne upon the ill
fortune, to mingle two the most diverse things that can bee, feare,
and rashnesse; rashnesse in the enterprize, and feare of the
successe.  For, when we valew the places your H.H. sustaine, we
cannot but know their dignity greater, then to descend to the
reading of these trifles: and, while we name them trifles, we have
depriv'd our selves of the defence of our Dedication.  But since
your L.L. have beene pleas'd to thinke these trifles some-thing,
heeretofore; and have prosequuted both them, and their Authour
living, with so much favour: we hope, that (they out-living him,
and he not having the fate, common with some, to be exequutor to
his owne writings) you will use the like indulgence toward them,
P E A R E , by humble offer of his playes, to your most noble
patronage.  Wherein, as we have justly observed, no man to come
neere your L.L. but with a kind of religious addresse; it hath bin
the height of our care, who are the Presenters, to make the present
worthy of your H.H. by the perfection.  But, there we must also
crave our abilities to be considerd, my Lords.  We cannot go
beyond our owne powers.  Country hands reach foorth milke,
creame, fruites, or what they have : and many Nations (we have
heard) that had not gummes & incense, obtained their requests
with a leavened Cake.  It was no fault to approach their Gods, by
what meanes they could:  And the most, though meanest, of thins
are made more precious, when they are dedicated to Temples.  In
that name therefore, we most humbly consecrate to your H.H.
these remaines of your servant Shakespeare; that what delight is in
them, may be ever your L.L. the reputation his, & the faults ours, if
any be committed, by a payre so carefull to shew their gratitude
both to the living, and the dead, as is.
